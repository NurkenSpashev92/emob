# Docker
# Ignore the local development environment's container data or build artifacts if necessary.
# Common build output directories or temporary files.
# If you have specific build output folders, list them here.

# VS Code
# Ignore the .vscode folder to avoid committing user-specific settings,
# but shared settings (like launch.json, settings.json, extensions.json)
# might be useful to keep and should be specifically excluded if necessary.
.vscode/

# macOS
# Ignore the macOS-specific file that stores custom attributes for folders.
.DS_Store

# Example of more comprehensive entries often found in standard templates:

# VS Code specific files to ignore (common practice is to ignore the whole folder or just some files inside)
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp

# .vscode/*.json # Uncomment if you want to ignore all JSON files inside .vscode

# macOS specific files
.DS_Store
*.AppleDouble
.LSOverride
